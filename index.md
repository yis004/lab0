## Background story of my coding passion
###### This is a Markdown file demonstration


When I was little, I always had **so many ideas** popping up in mind *every single day*.

But there was one problem that always bothers me - how can I turn them into realities? The answer is of course not ~daydreaming~!

While I kept searching for answers, I found the best path to chase after my goal at 17 years old. The answer is coding.

So without hesistation, I dive into the world of different programming languages. Different than many other coders, I was chasing after the fact of turning ideas into a application instead of the quality of the product.

In the fall of 2018, I wrote my first line of python code, and it of course was:

```
print("Hello world!")
```

When I entered college, I realized that a veteran coder cares about many different aspects other than simply displaying the functionalities.

Therefore, my new goal is to write GOOD programs that run fast and efficiently. And I follow the Steve Jobs quote: 
>“Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.”

## Alex's side interests

I have variety of passions aside from coding projects.

Back in elementary school, I played casual soccer games with my friends after school. I used to be goal keeper - aka the only player in field that doesn't require much running. But I never enter the league of playing soccer seriously. I guess I was more enjoying the fun of hanging out with friends than enjoying the sport itself.

I also love playing guitar and listening to music. I believe if there exist an universal language, it must be music. But due to the lack of free time, I am pausing the practice for a couple of months now. I am ready to pick up what I left behind when I have more time.

When I am off from busy works, I enjoy watching movies and TV shows. The top publisher on my list is Netflix, and I believe their productions are going to be the future trend.
